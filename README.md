## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee salaries in a company or corporate environment using machine learning algorithms. The objective is to assist Managers and Human Resources (HR) professionals in understanding the factors that influence employee salaries and predicting expected salaries for employees based on key attributes
## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze important factors affecting employee salaries.
- Predict salary ranges for employees using machine learning models.
## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source**: Edunet Foundation
- The dataset includes the following columns:
  - age	
  - workclass
  - fnlwgt
  - education
  - educational-num
  - marital-status
  - occupation
  - relationship
  - race
  - gender
  - capital-gain
  - capital-loss
  - hours-per-week
  - native-country
  - income
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
   - Python
   - Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
   - Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
## ⚙️ Models and Evaluation
  - LogisticRegression
  - RandomForestClassifier
  - KNeighborsClassifier
  - SVM
  - GradientBoosting
## 📊 Model Results

We trained and evaluated five different machine learning models to predict employee salaries. Each model was tested using accuracy as the performance metric.

### ✅ Comparison of Model Performance:

| Model                        | Accuracy Score |
|-------------------------------|-------------------|
| Logistic Regression           | **0.82**          |
| Random Forest                 | **0.86**          |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)     | **0.82**          |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM)  | **0.85**          |
| Gradient Boosting             | **0.87**          |
